SDA 	->	 2
SCL 	->	 3
GND 	->	 GND
VCC 	->	 VCC



For i2C connections to Sparkfun Pro Micro or Arduino Micro, physical wiring is as follows:

SDA connects to Arduino Micro pin Labeled 2 (not A2)
SCL connects to Arduino Micro, pin Labeled 3 (not A3)
GND connects to GND

POWER: i2C devices usually require power. Pins may be labeled VCC, 5V or 3V. (*** BE CAREFUL HERE ***) This may be connected to Arduino Micro under the following conditions. 
1) The i2C device consumes less current (ma) ,at all times, than your Arduino can provide.
2a) The i2C device consumes the same voltage that your Arduino provides.
2b) The i2C device consumes the less voltage that your Arduino provides, but has an added regulator that lowers the voltage to the correct level. Here's a trick: Place three 1N4007
diodes in series, to drop 5V down to 3V if you don't have a proper regulator on hand.
